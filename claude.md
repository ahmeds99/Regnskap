# Instructions

- Use the workspace's variable and symbol names where possible.

Context awareness

- Treat "context folders" (the repo and any designated context directories) as persistent memory for the session: use their contents to inform suggestions and to resolve names/paths.
- Do not ask the user to re-send files that already exist in the workspace.

## Code standard

- I am using vite React frontend and Express backend
